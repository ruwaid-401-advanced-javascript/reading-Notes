## Graphs
* A graph is a non-linear data structure 
* can be looked at as a collection of vertices
* connected by line segments named edges.

## Terminology

* Vertex: also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
* Edge: is a connection between two nodes.
* Neighbor: The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes
* Degree: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Undirected Graphs
graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional

## Directed Graphs (Digraph)
graph where every edge is directed.

## Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

## Connected
graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

## Disconnected
graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Acyclic Graph
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

## Cyclic Graphs
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

## Graph Representation
graphs representation:
1. Adjacency Matrix: is represented through a 2-dimensional array.
2. Adjacency List: 
  * the most common way to represent graphs. 
  * An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

## Weighted Graphs
A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges.

## Traversals
* Breadth First
* Depth First

## Real World Uses of Graphs
* GPS and Mapping
* Driving Directions
* Social Networks
* Airline Traffic
* Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
