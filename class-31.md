## Using the State Hook

## What’s a Hook?
Our new example starts by importing the useState Hook from React:
A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later.

## When would I use a Hook? 
If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component. We’re going to do that right now!


## How does this work?
by convention, we use set + state-variable to name this function
`useState()` takes a single param, which is the initial value to assign to the state variable

## Basic Hooks
* useState
* useEffect
* useContext
