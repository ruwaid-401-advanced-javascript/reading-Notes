## Redux
* is one of the hottest libraries in front-end development these days
* Redux is an application data-flow architecture, rather than a traditional library or a framework like Underscore.js and AngularJS.
* Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree 
* React uses “reducers” to hold and manage state.
  * Reducers typically manage just one part of the larger application state.

## Redux Store
* A store is where we declare what middleware you may need and the reducers that you'll use to manage your state data.
* This is where the application's state is stored, it identifies various reducers and middlewares that need to be made available and used globally.
