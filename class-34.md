## BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTING RBAC:
- `Current Status`: Create a list of every software, hardware and app that has some sort of security.
- `Current Roles`: Even if you do not have a formal roster and list of roles, determining what each individual team member does may only take a little discussion.
- `Write a Policy`: Any changes made need to be written for all current and future employees to see.
- `Make Changes`: Once the current security status and roles are understood (not to mention a policy is written), it’s time to make the changes.
- `Continually Adapt`: It’s likely that the first iteration of RBAC will require some tweaking.
