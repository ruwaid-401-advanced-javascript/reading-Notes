## Solving Problems
The most common mistake when try to solve a programming problem is trying to start writing code as soon as possible.

### A simple set of steps

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

## Act like you make $1000/hr
> “Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke

Still, many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission.
The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.

Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000.

Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.


We’re all busy — with work, our families, our friends. It’s not bad to be “busy.” But in the words of best-selling author Jeff Goins:

> “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”

### As You Think, So You Are

> “As a man thinketh, so is he. As he continues to think, so he remains.” -James Allen

*You teach people how to treat you.*

If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.
But if you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.

## How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving
Why is this important?
Problem solving is the meta-skill.

### Steps
1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

### So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

#### Here are the steps:
1. Understand
2. Plan
3. Divide
4. Stuck?
The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.
* Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
* Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
* Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

*Practice*
Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

Practice. Practice. Practice
