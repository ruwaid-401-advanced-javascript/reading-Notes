## Why would a developer choose to make data models?
 * Faster performance. A well-constructed database typically runs fast
 * Clearer scope. A data model provides a focus for determining scope
## What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
  CREAT/READ/UPDATE/DELETE
## What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
  * Postgres: relational database management system
  * MongoDB: NoSQL database program
## What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment(for node.js)
## Describe how NoSQL Databases scale horizontally
by adding more machines 
## Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases
pros: Flexible Scalability
cons: Less Support

## Name 3 cloud based NoSQL Databases
1. DynamoDB
2. mLab
3. Amazon Web Services



## Terms

* database: is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.
* data model: is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities
* CRUD: CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE are the four basic functions of persistent storage.A model should have the ability to perform at most these four functions in order to be complete.
* schema: refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed. The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database
* sanitize: In real world sanitize is to “clean” anything from “bad things”. In computer sciences it means the same thing. Mostly for security purposes, we protect the system from malicious data.
* Structured Query Language (SQL): is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). 
* Non SQL (NoSQL): referring to "non SQL" or "non relational". database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
* MongoDB: MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema.
* Mongoose: Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment(for node.js)
* record: is composed of fields and contains all the data about one particular item in a database.
* document: A document database is a type of nonrelational database that is designed to store and query data as JSON-like documents. 
* Object Relation Mapping (ORM):  is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages
