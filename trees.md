# Trees

## Terminologies
* Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
* Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree
* Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
* Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
* Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
* Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
* Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Traversals
Traversing a tree allows us to 
* search for a node
* print out the contents of a tree
* and much more! 

### categories of traversals
1. Depth First
2. Breadth First

#### Depth First
Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.
##### methods for depth first traversal:
* Pre-order: `root >> left >> right`
* In-order: `left >> root >> right`
* Post-order: `left >> right >> root`

#### Breadth First
Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. 
* breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree

## Binary Trees
### Adding a node
 use of breadth first traversal
### Big O
* time complexity for inserting a new node is `O(n)`
* Searching for a specific node will also be `O(n)`

## Binary Search Trees
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. 
* In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are 
  * smaller than the root are placed to the left,
  * values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.

### Searching a BST
Searching a BST can be done quickly, because all you do is compare the node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree. If the value is smaller, you only traverse the left side. If the value is larger, you only traverse the right side.

#### Big O
* time complexity for insertion and search operations is O(h)
* space complexity of a BST search would be O(1).
