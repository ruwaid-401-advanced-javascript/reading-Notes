## React Native
React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks

## Create native apps for Android and iOS using React
React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
## Written in JavaScript—rendered with native code
React primitives render to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the same native platform APIs other apps do.

## Native Development For Everyone
React Native lets you create truly native apps and doesn't compromise your users' experiences. It provides a core set of platform agnostic native components like View, Text, and Image that map directly to the platform’s native UI building blocks.

## Expo tools
With Expo tools, services, and React, you can build, deploy, and quickly iterate on native Android, iOS, and web apps from the same JavaScript codebase.

## ExpoKit 
is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project -- one that you would normally create using Xcode, Android Studio, or react-native init.
